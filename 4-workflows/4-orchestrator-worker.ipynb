    "### Orchestrator-Worker\n",
    "In the orchestrator-workers workflow, a central LLM dynamically breaks down tasks, delegates them to worker LLMs, and synthesizes their results.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use this workflow: This workflow is well-suited for complex tasks where you can’t predict the subtasks needed (in coding, for example, the number of files that need to be changed and the nature of the change in each file likely depend on the task). Whereas it’s topographically similar, the key difference from parallelization is its flexibility—subtasks aren't pre-defined, but determined by the orchestrator based on the specific input.\n"

    "### Creating Workers Dynamically In Langgraph \n",
    "Because orchestrator-worker workflows are common, LangGraph has the Send API to support this. It lets you dynamically create worker nodes and send each one a specific input. Each worker has its own state, and all worker outputs are written to a shared state key that is accessible to the orchestrator graph. This gives the orchestrator access to all worker output and allows it to synthesize them into a final output. As you can see below, we iterate over a list of sections and Send each to a worker node.

       "Okay, I need to write a report section called \"Introduction to Agentic AI and RAG Systems\" based on the user's description. They want me to define both Agentic AI and RAG systems, explain their purposes, and discuss how they come together in modern AI architectures. Let me start by recalling what I know about each.\n",
       "\n",
       "Agentic AI refers to AI systems that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to achieve specific goals. They can make decisions and take actions based on their environment and objectives. Maybe I should mention their ability to work independently, perhaps using reinforcement learning or decision-making processes. Examples might include autonomous agents in robotics or complex problem-solving tasks.\n",
       "\n",
       "RAG stands for Retrieve-Attend-Generate. From what I remember, RAG is a method used in natural language processing where the model retrieves information from a database, attends to relevant parts of the retrieved data, and then generates a response. This is different from traditional models that rely solely on internal knowledge. The retrieval part could use something like BM25 or a neural search, attention might involve transformers focusing on key documents, and generation is like a standard language model.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now, their convergence in modern systems would mean combining these approaches. Maybe AI agents (Agentic) use RAG to inform their decisions by retrieving and processing information from external sources. This integration allows for more informed and context-aware actions, as the agent can dynamically access and synthesize information as needed.\n",
       "\n",
       "I need to structure the section to first define each term separately, then explain how they come together. Let me check if there are standard definitions for Agentic AI. Maybe I should be precise, like Agentic AI being systems designed to perform tasks autonomously through goal-oriented decision-making. RAG's purpose is enhancing generative models with external knowledge. \n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, I should ensure that I'm not missing key components. The Retrieve step is about getting relevant data, Attend is selecting the most important parts, and Generate is creating the output. The convergence would mean that an Agentic AI uses RAG as part of its process to make better decisions by incorporating external information.\n",
       "\n",
       "I should also mention why their combination is beneficial. For instance, Agentic AI can leverage real-time or external data via RAG to adapt more effectively than if it relied solely on its training data. Applications might include chatbots accessing external documents, or autonomous systems making decisions based on up-to-date information.\n",
       "\n",
       "Let me outline the structure: Start with a paragraph on Agentic AI, then one on RAG, then their convergence. Use bullet points or bold terms for clarity. Also, make sure to highlight individual purposes before discussing their integration.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, the user specified to include no preamble for each section and use markdown. Since it's a report section, I should present it in paragraphs without subheadings. So first, define Agentic AI, then RAG, then explain their convergence. \n",
       "\n",
       "Check for any technical inaccuracies. Is RAG specifically a system where retrieval is followed by attention and generation? Yes, typically in NLP contexts, like in Q&A systems where the model retrieves documents, focuses on relevant parts, then generates an answer. \n",
       "\n",
       "Also, need to make sure that the explanation of their convergence is clear. Maybe modern AI architectures use RAG within an agent's decision-making loop, allowing the agent to dynamically retrieve information to inform its actions. This enhances capabilities beyond static knowledge.\n",
       "\n",
       "I should also mention that this combination addresses limitations of each standalone approach. Agentic AI without external knowledge might have outdated or insufficient data, while RAG systems without agency might not apply the information in a goal-directed way. Together, they form more robust systems.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alright, putting it all together in a coherent paragraph structure. Start with Agentic AI's purpose, then RAG's components and purpose, then their integration. Use examples to illustrate if possible, like an autonomous agent using RAG to solve a problem by accessing external data. Make sure terms like \"retrieve,\" \"attend,\" \"generate\" are clearly explained in context.\n",
       "\n",
       "Let me also verify the terminology. Agentic AI might sometimes be referred to as autonomous agents or goal-driven AI systems. RAG is a known architecture, so I should stick to that acronym. Avoid jargon where possible, but since it's a report, some technical terms are necessary.\n",
       "\n",
       "Okay, time to draft the section following these points, ensuring each part is covered without fluff. Use bold for key terms like Agentic AI and RAG when first mentioned.\n",
       "</think>\n",
       "\n",
       "**Introduction to Agentic AI and RAG Systems**  \n",
       "Agentic AI refers to autonomous or semi-autonomous artificial intelligence systems designed to pursue specific goals through decision-making and action. These systems operate in dynamic environments, leveraging algorithms such as reinforcement learning or planning to optimize outcomes. Their core purpose is to achieve predefined objectives with minimal human intervention, enabling applications like robotics, autonomous vehicles, and strategic problem-solving.  \n",
       "\n",
       "RAG (Retrieve-Attend-Generate) systems, meanwhile, are a class of models that combine large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge retrieval. They operate via three stages: **retrieve** (querying an external database for relevant documents), **attend** (selecting key information using attention mechanisms), and **generate** (producing a coherent output informed by the retrieved data). RAG’s primary purpose is to enhance a model’s contextual awareness and factual accuracy by dynamically integrating external knowledge beyond its training data.  \n",
       "\n",
       "The convergence of Agentic AI and RAG systems in modern architectures creates hybrid models capable of both autonomous decision-making and real-time knowledge synthesis. Agentic AI benefits from RAG’s ability to access and contextualize external information, while RAG provides actionable insights for the agent’s goal-driven processes. Together, they enable advanced applications such as AI assistants that dynamically synthesize research, autonomous systems that adapt to new data, or problem-solving agents that balance internal logic with external evidence. This integration addresses limitations of standalone systems, combining adaptive autonomy with scalable knowledge utilization.\n",
